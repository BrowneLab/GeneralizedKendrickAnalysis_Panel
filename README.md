# GeneralizedKendrickAnalysis_Panel

GKA_Panel1.1.ipf
Changes from previous version:
1) Per reviewer feedback on our pre-print (https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2022-1319) we changed the name of the analysis to Generalized Kendrick Analysis from Scaled Kendrick Analysis. The change is in name only - the analysis itself is identical to the previous code. 
2) This new version of the code includes error checking that the dimensions of the mass-to-charge ratio wave and the intensity wave were identical.

SKMD
Once the .ipf is loaded into Igor Pro and compiled, a menu option will appear called “SKMD Panel” which can be used to generate the panel.
Full details regarding SKMD are available in
