# GeneralizedKendrickAnalysis_Panel
General Information
Once the .ipf is loaded into Igor Pro and compiled, a menu option will appear called “Kendrick Analysis Panel” which can be used to generate the panel. It is recommended to be in the directory of the input waves before generating and running the panel.

Please note that this software is provided as is. We appreciate feedback regarding typos, performance issues, and/or suggestions for improvement. Please note that we are unable to provide extensive troubleshooting or other help although we can answer basic questions.

Most Recent version

GKA_Panel1.1.ipf
Changes from previous version:
1) Per reviewer feedback on our pre-print (https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2022-1319) we changed the name of the analysis to Generalized Kendrick Analysis from Scaled Kendrick Analysis. The change is in name only - the analysis itself is identical to the previous code. 
2) This new version of the code includes error checking that the dimensions of the mass-to-charge ratio wave and the intensity wave were identical.

Old Versions

SKMD_Panelv1.0.ipf
